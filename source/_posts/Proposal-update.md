Hi all, I've been deliberating over this for a while but it seems like now might be the best time to go through with this considering the price drop. I have realized recently that almost all of my free time has been dedicated to Ark and related projects since becoming a delegate even though my initial proposal only considered that I would be spending a few hours weekly to solve the fundamental research problems pertaining to DPoS. In light of this realization I'll be decreasing the sharing percentage from 80% to 70%. I wanted to wait until after my weekly payout was completed so people don't feel cheated. The new sharing percentage will be effective from next week's payout. That being said I have some really exciting stuff in the pipeline some of which I have hinted at in the past like introducing stealth addresses for Ark, whereas some stuff I would like to keep under wraps for now. If you liked my contributions so far I would be grateful for your continued support, otherwise you know what to do â€‹;)

P.S: look out for the recording of the recent dev meeting if you want to get a better understanding of the recently released AIP85.
