Hi all, I wanted to give a brief status update and get some feedback from my voters.
I'm at a point where I've almost run out of the theoretical ideas that could be converted to AIPs without any actual implementation. I still have plenty of ideas that I want to investigate but they all require me to spend lots of time implementing/changing core functionality to test out and see if they are feasible or not. I knew this point would come eventually and I had hoped that when it does Ark 3.0 would be available so I can take advantage of it's modularity and change core features and consensus rules etc but unfortunately that's not the case right now and I don't know how far away 3.0 is from release. The only option right now is that I implement something from scratch in C++ (since that's most comfortable for me) and test out my ideas in that. This might be a full implementation and it will test out different consensus mechanisms such as avalanche etc so it's unlikely that it will be compatible with ark core without a lot of effort. The lessons learned from these implementations and the tests carried out will then be converted into AIPs and standards that I will try to convert to ark plugins for v3.0 eventually.So basically there are 2 things that concern me and I want feedback on:

Implementing ideas and testing them before being able to write AIPs will mean that AIPs will come out after long time gaps in between. This will definitely make it seem like nothing's happening in the meanwhile.

The new core implementation might end up only being used for these tests. Or it might end up being it's own fully functional network (if it reaches this point I will make it interoperable with ark).

Would you as a voter like me to pursue this option? As I said I'm almost done with theoretical ideas so I'd have to scale back or change/retire my delegate otherwise. Please feel free to reach out via slack or reddit. Finally thanks for all your support so far :)
